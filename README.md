# REST API version 3 - Ubuntu 22.04

This version 3 REST API is built in Ubuntu 22.04. The code is similar to REST API version 2, but
built in Windows 10 with Docker as the primary containerization tool. The main difference is the
operating system and the containerization tool used.

Version 3 will still be using Docker as the containerization tool, but the operating system will be
Ubuntu 22.04.
